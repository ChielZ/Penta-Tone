MAIN
 √ Fix iOS 15 compatibility
 √ Add oscillator waveform to parameters
 √ add initial touch and aftertouch sensitivity
 - switch over to limited polyphony + voice management (round robin)
 - switch over to stereo architecture
 - try different filters
 - implement modulation generators
 - implement modulators in parameter structure
 - implement fine tune and octave adjustments
 - create preset management
 >> sanity check code structure
 - create developer view for sound editing/storing presets
 - add macro control
 - add drone note toggles to central note buttons?
 (- port engine to tonehive)
 - add in app documentation
 
UI
 √ ET / JI: display as EQUAL / JUST
 √ Improve spacing/layout
 √ Implement scale type graphics display (raw shapes or image files?)
 √ Implement note name display
 - Implement basic tooltip structure (toggle on/of in voice menu?)
 
MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
 √ Change intonation display from ET/JI to EQUAL / JUST
 √ Check font warning
 - distinguish between iPad landscape and iPad portrait for font sizes? (apparently tricky, couldn't get to work on first try - also, looking quite good already anyway)
 √ check delay dry/wet mix parameter direction, 0.0 is now fully wet and 1.0 is fully dry (?)
 - check: what is the update rate for touch (x position) changes? Filter sweep very choppy, cause?
 - accidentals don't resize properly in key display on iPhone (but they do in scale note display)
 
 
 CONCEPT FOR IMPROVED SOUND ENGINE:
 
 - There will be a polyphonic synth engine with some number of voices (5 would be a good start, this should be adjustable).
 - Instead of a 1 on 1 connection between keys and voices, there will be a dynamic voice allocation system with a simple round robin voice assignment system
 - The frequency of each voice will be updated each time it is triggered, dependant on the key that triggers it.
 - Each voice will get a second oscillator and a more sophisticated internal structure
 - In addition to the editable parameters, we will create dedicated modulators (LFOs, modulation envelopes), that will be able to update these parameters in realtime (at control rate, not at audio rate)
 - We will create a temporary 'developer view' allowing the creation of different presets (values for all audio and modulator parameters)
 - The final app will contain 15 different presets that should be browsable
 - We will also be creating a macro structure: while the final app will not allow the user to individually sculpt each parameter, there will be 4 macro sliders that map to one or more parameters, this will vary per preset.

 Add 'More details' section with:
 - what is a pentatonic scale?
 - basic scale construction
 - JI vs ET
 - The advantages of pentatonics
 - Some examples (Western Pentatonic major/Minor, Ethiopian, African, Japanese)
 - Diagrams ET, JI ratios, JI names
 
 
 
 IDEAS FOR IN APP PURCHASES (FOR FUTURE VERSIONS OF APP)
 - Sound design: unlock 'developer view' with full access to all sound parameters plus option to create and store presets
 - Midi out: add midi output functionality, optimally in 4 versions:
    1) Standard >> polyphonic ET, compatible with any midi synthesizers (single selectable midi channel)
    2) Pitch bend JI >> works monophonically with any midi synthesizers (single selectable midi channel)
    3) MPE JI >> works polyphonically with MPE-capable synthesizers (multi channel)
    4) JI through .scala/.tun >> works polyphonically with synthesizers that support .tun/.scala (single selectable midi channel)
 - DAW integration: AUv3 for Garageband, Ableton link functionality
 - Pro package consisting of all three updgrades (sound editor, midi out, DAW integration)
 Pricing idea: around €3 each for single IAPs, or €6 for all three (pro package)
 
 
 
 CONCEPT FOR FINAL STRUCTURE OF EDITABLE PARAMETERS / SOUND EDITING SCREENS
 
 
 1. VOICE
 
 a) Oscillator (the same parameter values will be applied to both the left-panned and right-panned FMOscillators
 - Waveform (shared between Carrier and Modulator, options: sine, triangle, square)
 - Carrier multiplier (=>carrierMultiplier)
 - Modulator multiplier coarse (=>modulatingMultiplier, integer values)
 - Modulator multiplier fine (=> modulatingMultiplier, .00 - .99)
 - Modulator base level (=> modulationIndex)
 - Amplitude (=>amplitude)
 
 b) Stereo spread
 - Offset mode (absolute vs relative)
 - Offset amount
 
 c) Filter
 - Cutoff
 - Resonance
 - Saturation
 
 d) AmplitudeEnvelope
 - Attack time
 - Decay time
 - Sustain level
 - Release time
 
 
 2. FX CHAIN
 
 a) Delay
 - Delay time (implement as sync to master tempo?)
 - Delay feedback
 - Delay PingPong
 - Delay mix
 
 b) Reverb
 - Reverb size
 - Reverb tone
 - Reverb mix
 
 
 3. MASTER
 
 - Tempo
 - Voice mode (polyphonic/monophonic)
 - Root frequency
 - Octave
 - Fine tune
 - Master volume (pre or post fx? For pre fx, could be mapped to voicemixer volume)
 
 
 4. MODULATION
 
 a) Modulator envelope (should exist per-voice, destination is 'hard wired' to oscillators' modulationIndex)
 - Attack time
 - Decay time
 - Sustain level
 - Release time
 - Envelope amount (=> modulationIndex + Modulation envelope value * envelope amount)
 
 b) Auxiliary Envelope (should exist per-voice)
 - Attack time
 - Decay time
 - Sustain level
 - Release time
 - destination (Oscillator baseFrequency, modulatingMultiplier, Filter frequency [default], Voice LFO frequency, Voice LFO mod amount)
 - amount (unipolar modulation, so positive and negative amount)

 c) Voice LFO (should exist per-voice)
 - waveform (sine, triangle, square, sawtooth, reversed sawtooth)
 - reset mode (free, trigger, sync)
 - frequency (0-10 Hz or tempo multipliers depending on mode)
 - destination (Oscillator baseFrequency [default], modulationIndex, modulatingMultiplier, Filter frequency, stereo spread offset amount)
 - amount (bipolar modulation, so only positive amounts)

 d) Global LFO (should exist as a single LFO on global level
 - waveform (sine, triangle, square, sawtooth, reversed sawtooth)
 - reset mode (free, sync)
 - frequency (0-10 Hz or tempo multipliers depending on mode)
 - destination (Oscillator amplitude [default], Oscillator baseFrequency, modulationIndex, modulatingMultiplier, Filter frequency, delay time, delay amount)
 - amount (bipolar modulation, so only positive amounts)
 
 e) Key tracking (value proportional to frequency of triggered key)
  - destination (Oscillator amplitude, modulationIndex, modulatingMultiplier, Filter frequency, Voice LFO frequency, Voice LFO mod amount)
  - amount (unipolar modulation, so positive and negative amount)

 e) X initial touch (x position of key trigger touch)
 - destination (Oscillator amplitude, modulationIndex, modulatingMultiplier, Filter frequency, Voice LFO frequency, Voice LFO mod amount)
 - amount (unipolar modulation, so positive and negative amount)
 
 f) X aftertouch (change in x position of touch while key is being held)
 - destination (Oscillator amplitude, modulationIndex, modulatingMultiplier, Filter frequency, Voice LFO frequency, Voice LFO mod amount)
 - amount (bipolar modulation, so only positive amounts)
 ? toggle for relative/absolute mode
 
 
 
 >>> the modulation sources below, y touch sensitivity and touchArea detection will not be implemented in this particular app, but it would be good to add them to the synth engine for purposes of portability / reusability)
 
 g) Y initial touch (y position of key trigger touch)
 - destination (Oscillator amplitude, modulationIndex, modulatingMultiplier, Filter frequency, Voice LFO frequency, Voice LFO mod amount)
 - amount (unipolar modulation, so positive and negative amount)
 
 h) Y aftertouch (change in y position of touch while key is being held)
 - destination (Oscillator amplitude, modulationIndex, modulatingMultiplier, Filter frequency, Voice LFO frequency, Voice LFO mod amount)
 - amount (bipolar modulation, so only positive amounts)
 ? toggle for relative/absolute mode
 
 i) Velocity sensitivity through 'touchArea' detection
 - destination (Oscillator amplitude, modulationIndex, modulatingMultiplier, Filter frequency, Voice LFO frequency, Voice LFO mod amount)
 - amount (unipolar modulation, so positive and negative amount)
